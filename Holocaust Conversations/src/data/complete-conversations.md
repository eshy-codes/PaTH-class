# Complete Conversation Structure

This file tracks which nodes need to be added to complete all conversation paths.

## Anne Frank - Missing Terminal Nodes

All paths should eventually lead to "end" node. Here are common terminal patterns needed:

1. Nodes that acknowledge and conclude meaningfully
2. Each should have userChoices leading to "end"
3. Total conversation should feel complete after 10-15 exchanges

## Structure for other characters
Same pattern - 10-15 meaningful exchanges leading to conclusion
